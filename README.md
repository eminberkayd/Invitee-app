This app is made for the need of tracking invitee list for events. We can create multiple events and add people to the invitee list or delete from the list. I made this project with React Native and used the UI component library  <a href="https://github.com/yamankatby/react-native-material">React Native Material</a>. Below, you can see how it works on an iOS device. The warning appears because I used prop drilling for a state setter function.
